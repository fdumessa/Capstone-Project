# Capstone-Project
- Building Permits Issued in Nashville over a rolling three-years period of May,2017 to May,2020.
- Nashville is one of the fastest growing cities in United States of America. There are a lot of constructions all over downtown Nashville.
- what type of permitted issued most?
- How much is the construction cost?
- Which area of Nashville (Zip code) is the hottest area for investors?
- Which year building permits issued the most for Hotel and General office?
- When we compare month to month building permits issued, how is the impact for the first five months of 2020 after COVID19 pandemic?
- I use tableau for visualization after I clean, explore, and manipulate the data by using Python and Excel.
